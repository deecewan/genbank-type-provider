# Project Management

## Time Management

To ensure that the project is completed on time, and that the scope of the
project does not creep beyond what is achievable, a Gantt chart of the required
tasks has been prepared. This can be seen in Appendix. A.

## Success Management

To ensure success of the project, regular meeting (generally once a week,
occasionally once a fortnight) are held with the project supervisor in person or
via phone.

A way of validating that the project has achieved its goals has not yet been
determined of the project is yet to be determined.
